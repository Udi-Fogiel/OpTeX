\tit \OpTeX/ Markup Language Standard

{\it\hfil Petr Olšák, 2021}\bigskip

The \OpTeX/ markup language standard (OMLS) declares a list of control
sequences used in \OpTeX/ documents including their syntax and sematic. The
listed control sequences in OMLS in section~\ref[listcs]
are called {\it known} and other control sequences are {\it unknown}.

The main reason for OMLS is to give instructions on how to program convertors
from \OpTeX/ documents to another formats (Html, Markdown, \LaTeX/) or how
to interpret the \OpTeX/ document sources in such applications as
{\tt texcount} or color highlighting in editors\fnote
{Or advanced editor features: hiding/uncovering sections/chapters,
 auto-completions, etc.}.
These converters and applications are called {\it cnv-programs} in this document.

We suppose that if you need absolute control over the typography of the
document when it is converted to PDF pages, then you use \OpTeX/ itself. If
you need to create other formats of the same document then you can use a
cnv-program which accepts OMLS. The result is a document without
typographical instructions like dimensions of pages, margins, paginations
and headers, selection of a font-family, dimensions of the fonts, etc.\ You can
imagine the result of such a conversion as one Html page where more
typographical features can be controlled in a different way, for example by
an external CSS file. This is a reason why control sequences like `\fontfam` or
`\margins` are ignored by cnv-programs.

Obviously, \TeX/ and \OpTeX/ itself gives possibility to declare various
input formats for various purposes. Sometimes (in very special cases) there
exists a good reason to declare a different and special input format by
\TeX/ macros. But if the source of the document respects the OMLS then it is
reasonably transformable to other formats by cnv-programs. We hope that
OMLS-ready documents cover a very large set of typical documents used these
days.

We suppose that cnv-programs work internally with strings of source lines
without tokenization. This is one of the great difference in processing the
document directly by \OpTeX/ and using a cnv-program. The second difference is
that the expansion process of macros is not implemented in cnv-programs in
its full range. We respect that the result of cnv-programs will be different
than from processing directly by \OpTeX/. But this is not a bug, this is
the feature. We concentrate on the fixed syntax and sematic given by OMLS of the
\OpTeX/ document and we throw behind the head the typographical
exactness of the document which can be done only directly by \TeX/ (and it is
exactly described in \TeX/book, for example).

\sec Syntactical rules

The syntactical elements are described as strings here. No \TeX/'s tokenization is
taken into account. The rule with a smaller number has precedence.

\begitems \style n
* end of line or end of file \: `<eol>`.\r[eol]
* `%%:` at beginning of the line \: <cnv-declarator>, see section~\ref[cnv-decl].
* `<cnv-declarator><text><eol>` is interpreted specially.
* space or a tab-character \: `<space>`.
* non-empty sequence of `<space>`s \: `<spaces>`.
* a line only with `<spaces>` \: `<empty-line>`.\r[spcs]
* a character `a`--`z` or `A`--`Z` \: `<letter>`.
* a  `<letter>` or `_` \: `<specletter>`.
* a character different from previous rule or `<eol>` or `<spaces>` \: `<non-spec-letter>`
* `\<non-specletter>` \: `<singlechar-control-sequence>`.\r[scs]
* a non-empty sequence of `<specletter>`s \: `<letters-seq>`.
* `\<letters-seq><non-specletter>` \: `<multiletter-control-sequence><non-specletter>`.
* `%<text><eol>` \: `<comment>` and it is completely ignored including `<eol>`.\r[com]
* `<spaces>` at beginning of the line marks that the line as {\it indented}.
* `<spaces>` at beginning of the line \: are ignored.\r[bspace]
* `<spaces><eol>` or `<eol>` \: `<space>`.\r[eolrm]
* `<multileter-control-sequence><spaces>` \: `<multileter-control-sequence>`.\r[csspace]
* `<multiletter-control-sequence>` or `<singlechar-control-sequence>` \: `<control-sequence>`.\r[cs]
* `<spaces>` \: `<space>`.\r[sspace]
* `~` \: non-breakable space.
* text where all pairs `{` and `}` match at arbitrary level \: `<balanced text>`.\r[balt]
* `{<balanced text>}` can be interpreted as a parameter followed by a <control-sequence>, see section~\ref[listcs].
* The `{` alone not used by previous rule opens a group and the `}` alone closes the same group.
* There are two main modes: h-mode, v-mode\fnote
  {this is great simplification of real \TeX/ modes.}.
  The document processing starts in v-mode.
* In v-mode: a single `<non-space>` character or control sequences listed
  in table~\ref[vtohmode] swithes to h-mode.
* In h-mode: an empty line or control sequences listed in table~\ref[htovmode] switches to v-mode.\r[htov]
* The switching from v-mode to h-mode \: a paragraph begins.
* The switching from h-mode to v-mode \: the current paragraph ends.
* `$<text>$` or `$$<text>$$` \: process `<text>` in math-mode, see section~\ref[math].
* a non-empty sequence of digits with optional `+` or `-` in the front \: `<number>`.
* `<number>` with optional dot inside the sequence of digits \: `<decimal-number>`.
* a pair of letters listed in the table~\ref[tex-units] \: `<tex-unit>`.
* optional space, i.e.\ `<space>` or nothing \: `<o-space>`.
* `<decimal-number><o-space><tex-unit><o-space>` \: `<dimen>`.
* `<control-sequence>` not listed in section~\ref[listcs] nor in configuration \: `<unknown-control-sequence>`.\r[unkncs]
* `=<o-space>` or `<o-space>` \: `<o-equal>`.
* `<unknown-control-sequence><o-equal><dimen>` \: should be completely ignored.\r[eqdim]
* `<unknown-control-sequence><o-equal><number>` \: should be completely ignored.
* `<unknown-control-sequence>=<o-space>{<balanced-text>}` \: should be completely ignored.
* `<unknown-control-sequence>{<balanced-text>}` \: `<balanced-text>` alone.\r[ibrt]
* `<unknown-control-sequence>[<balanced-text>]` \: should be completely ignored.\r[ibkt]
* `<unknown-control-sequence>` \: should be ignored.
* `<control-sequence>`s are processed as described in section~\ref[listcs] or
  by a configuration of the cnv-program.

\sec Scaning parameters

If a control sequence listed in rules above or in the section~\ref[listcs]
has a parameter, the parameter is scanned
as a string with interpreatation only those rules which are needed to
determine the boundary of the parameters. For example `\tit <title><eol>`
applies only rule~\ref[eol] during scanning the parameter, i.e.\ `<title>`
is a string delimetered by the end of line or the end of file.
Or `\mnote{<balanced-text>}` applies only rule~\ref[balt].

If the parameter is in the format `{<something>}` then the `<something>` is
always `<balanced-text>`. We don't specify the type `<balanced-text>`
explicitly here, so we refer `\mnote{<text>}`, for example.

The spaces before scanned parameter or before `{<text>}` are optional
and they are ignored. Spaces inside `{`...`}` are not ignored.

If the parameter is in the format `{<something>}` and the first non-space
character is not `{` then the parameter is this first non-space character or
a `<control-sequence>` if the first non-space character is~`\`. For example
`\mnote a` is equal to `\mnote{a}`. The difference from this rule is given
for `\input`, `\verbinput`,`\inspic` and `\inkinspic`.

If the parameter is scanned as a string already then
the all syntactical rules are applied when it is used. For example:
\begtt
\tit    This is   a title
\endtt
the parameter is scaned as `This is   a title` and the rule~\ref[spcs] is
applied when the prameter is used.


\sec Declaration and text parts of the document

A typical \OpTeX/ document has two parts. A declaration part, where
macros are defined by `\def` and friends, fonts and sizes are declared, etc.
This part should be ignored by cnv-programs.
The second part includes the document text with a markup using well-declared control
sequences. The cnv-program has to interpret the second part.

So, the cnv-program starts in declaration-skipping mode and it switches to
the text mode later.

When cnv-program is in declaration-skipping mode then all indented lines are
ignored. And lines which begins by `}` or by a <control-sequence> not listed
in table~\ref[textopen] are ignored too.

If the line begins by a character other than `}` or by a <control-sequence>
listed in table~\ref[textopen] then cnv-program switches to text mode. All
texts are interpreted from this line including this one.

User can say explicitly where the second part of the document starts by
`%%:text` given at beginning of a line. Moreover, if `%%:decl` is given at
beginning of a line, then all text between `%%:decl` and `%%:text` is
ignored, only other possible `<cnv-declarator>`s are processed here.
The declaration part and the text part of the document can be fully determined
by `%%:decl` and `%%:text`.

\sec[cnv-decl] The `%%:` declarators

The `%%:` declarators are ignored when the document is processed by \TeX/
but they can give instructions to cnv-programs. The `%%:` must be placed at
beginning of the line. The list of `%%:` declarators follows:

\begitems
* `%%:decl` -- the following text is ignored until `%%:text` occurs. Only
  other `%%:` declarators are interpreted.
* `%%:text` -- the following text must be interpreted in text mode.
* `%%:to <format> <config-file>` -- if the cnv-program converts to the
  <format> then it has to use the <config-file>. For example:
  \begtt
  %%:to html html-mydocument.cfg
  %%:to markdown markdown-mydocument.cfg
  %%:to latex preamble-mydocument.cfg
  \endtt
  The language of the config files are not a part of this standard, we
  suppose something to be natural for used cnv-program. The config file should
  give additional rules for interpreting control sequences not listed in the
  section~\ref[listcs] (see rule~\ref[unkncs]). For example a simple alternative
  of `\def` commands can be here. Users can declare more control sequences
  depending on the converted document and on the output format by the
  configuration files. For example, a special \LaTeX/ preamble should be declared
  here when conversion to \LaTeX/ is processed.
* `%%:app <application> <config-file>` -- behaves like `%%;to` but the application
  name instead output format is given here.
* `%%:skip <formats-or-apps>` -- ignores all following lines until another `%%:` occurs
  if the output format or application name is included in the `<formats-or-apps>`
  space-separated list. Example:
  \begtt
  %%:skip html markdown
  This text is not interpreted when Html or Markdown output is generated.
  %%:
  \endtt
  If the `<formats-or-apps>` is empty then the `%%:skip` is applied for
  each cnv-program and for each output.
* `%%:if <formats-or-apps>` -- processes following lines until another `%%:`
  only if the output format or application name is included in the
  `<formats-or-apps>` space-separated list. Other cnv-programs or otput
  formats not mentioned here are skipped. Note that \TeX/ processes such
  lines always. But you can use `\ignoreit{<text>}` which is processed as
  `<text>` by cnv-programs (see rule~\ref[ibrt]) but it is ignored by \OpTeX.
  Example:
  \begtt
  %%:if html latex
  \ignoreit{\input{file.tex}}
  %%:
  \endtt
  The `file.tex` in this example is processed only if \LaTeX/ or Html output is generated.
* `%%:verbchar <character>` -- declares `<character>` as boundary character
  for inline verbatim.\nl
  Default: `%%:verbchar `\code{`}.
  Note that default setting is different from \OpTeX/ defaults where the
  `\activettchar` is undeclared by default.
  You can undeclare this character by `%%:verbchar` without parameter.
* `%%:quotes <qql> <qqr> <ql> <qr>` -- declares `<qql>` and `<qqr>`: left
  and right double quotation marks, `<ql>` and `<qr>`: left and right single
  quotation mark. They are used when `\"` or `\'` control sequences are
  processed. Default: `%%:quotes “ ” ‘ ’`.
  Note that default setting is different from \OpTeX/ defaults where the
  `\<lang>quotes` are undeclared and `\"`, `\'` are undefined by default.
  You ca undeclare this feature by `%%:quotes` without parameters. Then the
  control sequences `\"` and `\'` are interpreted as unknown.

\sec[listcs] List of known control sequences

The phrase \"should be" is used very often when the interpretation of
control sequences are declared here. It means that this is aonly a common
interpretation, but differeces are possible due to the type of the output
format and used cnv-program. For example, when we convert to \LaTeX\, then
`\-` and `\/` are not ignored but they are re-written without change to the
output of the \LaTeX/ source file.

\secc Character-like control sequences

\begitems
* `\%`, `\$`, `\&`,`\#` respectively \: should be normal characters `%`, `$`, `&`, `#` respectively.
* `\bslash` \: normal character `\`.
* `\space`, `\<space>`, `\<eol>` \: space.
* `\,` \: should be small space or space.
* `\quad`, `\qquad` \: should be bigger space or more spaces.
* `\-`, `\/` \: should be ignored.
\enditems

\secc Input files

\begitems
* `\input {<file-name>}` or `\input <file-name><space>` should redirect the
  input to given file. At the end of input-ed file or at `\endinput` the
  reading of current file continues.
* `\inspic {<file-name>}` or `\inspic <file-name><space>` should include the
  given picture from the `<file-name>`.
* `\inkinspic {<file-name>}` or `\inkinspic <file-name><space>` behaves like
  `\inspic`.
* `\verinput <ignore> (<lines>) <file-name><space>` should include the
  <file-name> (only given lines) as a verbatim text, i.\,e. without any
  syntactical interpretation.
\enditems

\secc Titles

\begitems
* `\tit <title><eof>` should be a title of the document.
* `\chap <title><eof>` or `\chap [<label>] <title><eof>` is the title of
  first level.
* `\sec <title><eof>` or `\sec [<label>] <title><eof>` is the title of
  second level.
* `\secc <title><eof>` or `\secc [<label>] <title><eof>` is the title of
  third level.
* `\secl<level> <title><eof>` is the title of given level.
