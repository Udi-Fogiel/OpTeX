\tit \OpTeX/ Markup Language Standard

{\it\hfil Petr Olšák, 2021}\bigskip

The \OpTeX/ markup language standard (OMLS) declares a list of control
sequences used in \OpTeX/ documents including their syntax and sematic. The
listed control sequences in OMLS are called {\it known} and other control
sequences are {\it unknown}.

The main reason for OMLS is to give instructions on how to program convertors
from \OpTeX/ documents to another formats (Html, Markdown, \LaTeX/) or how
to interpret the \OpTeX/ document sources in such applications as
`texcount` or color highlighting in editors\fnote
{Or advanced editor features: hiding/uncovering sections/chapters,
 auto-completions, etc.}.
These converters and applications are called {\it cnv-programs} in this document.

We suppose that if you need absolute control over the typography of the
document when it is converted to PDF pages, then you use \OpTeX/ itself. If
you need to create other formats of the same document then you use a
cnv-program which accepts this OMLS. The result is a document without
typographical instructions like dimensions of pages, margins, paginations
and headers, selection of a font-family, dimensions of the fonts, etc.\ You can
imagine the result of such a conversion as one Html page where more
typographical features can be controlled in a different way, for example by
an external CSS file. This is a reason why control sequences like `\fontfam` or
`\margins` are ignored by cnv-programs.

Obviously, \TeX/ and \OpTeX/ itself gives possibility to declare various
input formats for various purposes. Sometimes (in very special cases) there
exists a good reason to declare a different and special input format by
\TeX/ macros. But if the source of the document respects the OMLS then it is
reasonably transformable to other formats by cnv-programs. We hope that
OMLS-ready documents cover a very large set of typical documents used these
days.

We suppose that cnv-programs work internally with strings of source lines
without tokenization. This is one of the great difference in processing the
document directly by \OpTeX/ and using a cnv-program. The second difference is
that the expansion process of macros is not implemented in cnv-programs in
its full range. We respect that the result of cnv-programs will be different
than from processing directly by \OpTeX/. But this is not a bug, this is
the feature. We concentrate on the fixed syntax and sematic given by OMLS of the
\OpTeX/ document and we throw behind the head the typographical
exactness of the document which can be done only directly by \TeX/ (and it is
exactly described in \TeX/book, for example).

\sec Syntactical elements

The syntactical elements are described as strings here. No \TeX/'s tokenization is
taken into account. The rule with a smaller number has precedence.

\begitems \style n
* end of line \: `<eol>`.
* `%%:` at beginning of the line \: <cnv-declarator>, see section~\ref[cnv-decl].

* `{<balanced text>}` can be interpreted as a parameter followed by a <control-sequence>, see section~\ref[listcs].
* The `{` alone not used by previous rule opens a group and the `}` alone closes the same group.
* There are two main modes: h-mode, v-mode\fnote
  {this is great simplification of real \TeX/ modes.}.
  The document processing starts in v-mode.
* In v-mode: a single `<non-space>` character or control sequences listed
  in table~\ref[vtohmode] swithes to h-mode.
* In h-mode: an empty line or control sequences listed in table~\ref[htovmode] switches to v-mode.\r[htov]
* The switching from v-mode to h-mode \: a paragraph begins.
* The switching from h-mode to v-mode \: the current paragraph ends.
* `$<text>$` or `$$<text>$$` \: process `<text>` in math-mode, see section~\ref[math].
* a non-empty sequence of digits with optional `+` or `-` in the front \: `<number>`.
* `<number>` with optional dot inside the sequence of digits \: `<decimal-number>`.
* a pair of letters listed in the table~\ref[tex-units] \: `<tex-unit>`.
* optional space, i.e.\ `<space>` or nothing \: `<o-space>`.
* `<decimal-number><o-space><tex-unit><o-space>` \: `<dimen>`.
* `<control-sequence>` not listed in section~\ref[listcs] nor in configuration \: `<unknown-control-sequence>`.\r[unkncs]

* `<unknown-control-sequence><o-equal><dimen>` \: should be completely ignored.\r[eqdim]
* `<unknown-control-sequence><o-equal><number>` \: should be completely ignored.
* `<unknown-control-sequence>=<o-space>{<balanced-text>}` \: should be completely ignored.
* `<unknown-control-sequence>{<balanced-text>}` \: `<balanced-text>` alone.\r[ibrt]
* `<unknown-control-sequence>[<balanced-text>]` \: should be completely ignored.\r[ibkt]

\sec Declaration and text parts of the document

A typical \OpTeX/ document has two parts. A declaration part, where
macros are defined by `\def` and friends, fonts and sizes are declared, etc.
This part should be ignored by cnv-programs.
The second part includes the document text with a markup using well-declared control
sequences. The cnv-program has to interpret the second part.

So, the cnv-program starts in declaration-skipping mode and it switches to
the text mode later.

When cnv-program is in declaration-skipping mode then all indented lines are
ignored. And lines which begins by `}` or by a <control-sequence> not listed
in table~\ref[textopen] are ignored too.

If the line begins by a character other than `}` or by a <control-sequence>
listed in table~\ref[textopen] then cnv-program switches to text mode. All
texts are interpreted from this line including this one.

User can say explicitly where the second part of the document starts by
`%%:text` given at beginning of a line. Moreover, if `%%:decl` is given at
beginning of a line, then all text between `%%:decl` and `%%:text` is
ignored, only other possible `<cnv-declarator>`s are processed here.
The declaration part and the text part of the document can be fully determined
by `%%:decl` and `%%:text`.

\sec[cnv-decl] The `%%:` declarators

The `%%:` declarators are ignored when the document is processed by \TeX/
but they can give instructions to cnv-programs. The `%%:` must be placed at
beginning of the line. The list of `%%:` declarators follows:

\begitems
* `%%:decl` -- the following text is ignored until `%%:text` occurs. Only
  other `%%:` declarators are interpreted.
* `%%:text` -- the following text must be interpreted in text mode.
* `%%:to <format> <config-file>` -- if the cnv-program converts to the
  <format> then it has to use the <config-file>. For example:
  \begtt
  %%:to html html-mydocument.cfg
  %%:to markdown markdown-mydocument.cfg
  %%:to latex preamble-mydocument.cfg
  \endtt
  The language of the config files are not a part of this standard, we
  suppose something to be natural for used cnv-program. The config file should
  give additional rules for interpreting control sequences not listed in the
  section~\ref[listcs] (see rule~\ref[unkncs]). For example a simple alternative
  of `\def` commands can be here. Users can declare more control sequences
  depending on the converted document and on the output format by the
  configuration files. For example, a special \LaTeX/ preamble should be declared
  here when conversion to \LaTeX/ is processed.
* `%%:app <application> <config-file>` -- behaves like `%%;to` but the application
  name instead output format is given here.
* `%%:skip <formats or apps>` ignores all following lines until another `%%:` occurs
  if the output format or application name is included in the <formats or apps>
  list (separated by space). Example:
  \begtt
  %%:skip html markdown
  This text is not interpreted when Html or Markdown output is generated.
  %%:
  \endtt
