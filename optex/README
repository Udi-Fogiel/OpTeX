base/  ... basic set of macro files used when optex.fmt is generated
           and more basic macros loaded on demand during document processing.
demo/  ... examples: short document: op-demo.tex, short letter: op-letter.tex,
           presentation slides: op-slides.tex.
pkg/   ... external macros. Maybe, they can be created by other authors if 
           the macro file conforms to the rules given in the section 2.2.5 
           in the OpTeX documentation.
doc/   ... PDF version of the OpTeX documentation and sources.
